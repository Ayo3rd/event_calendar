# Event Calendar

* My home page is a dynamic calendar that shows the users the events for the current month.
  * There is a flyer section that shows the most upcoming event flyer
  * Clicking the events in the calendar should show the flyer in the flyer section
* The Event Request page allows users to create an event and add to the database to be added to the
calendar pending Admin Approval
* The Event Confirmation page confirms the userâ€™s input and shows the user.
* The Request List page serves as an Admin page of sorts.
  * The user can approve an event
  * The user can delete an event
